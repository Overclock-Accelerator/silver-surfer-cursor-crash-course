                        <h3>🏠 Favorite Destination</h3>
                        <p><strong>Titan</strong> - The only place where cosmic existential crises are considered normal conversation topics. Plus, Mentor gives great advice.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="story-card">
                        <h3>😰 Least Favorite</h3>
                        <p><strong>Contraxia</strong> - Too much fun, too much noise, not enough meaningful cosmic contemplation. Sometimes a cosmic being just needs some peace and quiet.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="story-card">
                        <h3>💔 Most Emotional</h3>
                        <p><strong>Zen-Whoberi</strong> - His greatest regret. A reminder of the consequences of his time as Galactus's herald. The guilt still haunts him.</p>

                    <div class="story-card">
                        <h3>🤯 Most Surprising</h3>
                        <p><strong>Ego the Living Planet</strong> - When you literally have a conversation with a sentient planet about loneliness. That's peak cosmic weirdness right there.</p>
