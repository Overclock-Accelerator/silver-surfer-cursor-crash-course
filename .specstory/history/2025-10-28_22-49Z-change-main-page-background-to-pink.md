<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to change the background of the main page to pink. Let me first understand what the main page is. Looking at the project structure, there's an `index.html` file which is likely the main page. The user currently has it open.

I should:
1. Check the current `styles.css` file to see how the background is currently styled
2. Check `index.html` to understand the structure and see if there are inline styles or specific class names for the main page
3. Modify the appropriate CSS to make the background pink

Let me start by reading both files to understand the current setup.</details></think>

I'll help you change the background of the main page to pink. Let me first check the current styling setup.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the current styling. The body background is set to black (#000000) on line 25. To change the main page background to pink, I'll need to update the body background color. I should also consider the starfield effects created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, which might need adjusting for visibility on a pink background.

Let me change the body background color to pink. I'll use a nice pink color like #FFC0CB (a standard pink).</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've changed the background color to pink. The change was made successfully. Let me summarize what I did:

1. I changed line 25 in styles.css from `background: #000000;` (black) to `background: #FFC0CB;` (pink)

This will make the main page have a pink background instead of the current black space theme. The starfield effects from the pseudo-elements will still be visible on top of the pink background.</details></think>

Done! I've changed the main page background to pink.

**What was changed:**
Updated `styles.css` line 25: changed the body background from `#000000` (black) to `#FFC0CB` (pink).

The pink background will now display across the entire main page, with the starfield effects still visible on top of it.
