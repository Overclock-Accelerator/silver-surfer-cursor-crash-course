# Enhance rollover effect for prompts (2025-09-29 19:01Z)

_**User (2025-09-29 18:25Z)**_

@powers.html I want to make the rollover effect associated with each prompt more pronounced. I really want an exaggerated effect

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to make the rollover/hover effect on the powers.html page more pronounced and exaggerated. They're referring to the power cards.

Let me first check the styles.css to see what the current hover effects are, then I can make them more exaggerated.</details></think>

I'll help you create a more exaggerated hover effect for the power cards. Let me first check the current styles to see what we're working with.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: styles.css

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the current hover effects for `.power-card`. Currently, it has:
- `transform: translateY(-5px)` - moves up by 5px
- `box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.2)` - adds a modest shadow
- `border-color: var(--cosmic-silver)` - changes border color

To make this more exaggerated and pronounced, I'll:
1. Increase the translateY to move it up more
2. Add scale transformation to make it bigger
3. Increase the shadow intensity and spread
4. Add a more pronounced glow effect
5. Maybe add a slight rotation for dramatic effect
6. Increase the transition duration for a more noticeable effect
7. Add background brightness or color shift

Let me update the styles.css file with more dramatic hover effects.</details></think>

I'll make the hover effects on the power cards significantly more exaggerated and dramatic. Here's the plan:

**Plan:**
1. Increase transform scale and lift
2. Add dramatic glow effects
3. Enhance shadows
4. Add subtle rotation
5. Brighten background
6. Slow down transition for more noticeable effect

Perfect! I've significantly enhanced the hover effects on the power cards. Here are the exaggerated effects now applied:

**Enhancements Made:**

1. **Dramatic Lift & Scale** - Cards now lift 20px (up from 5px) and scale to 108% size
2. **Subtle Rotation** - Added a 1-degree tilt for dynamic movement
3. **Triple-Layered Shadow** - Multiple shadows create depth:
   - Large outer shadow (60px spread)
   - Glowing halo effect (40px cosmic silver glow)
   - Inner glow for dimension
4. **Enhanced Background** - Background brightens from 10% to 20% opacity
5. **Thicker Border** - Border thickness doubles on hover
6. **Slower Transition** - Increased from 0.3s to 0.5s for more noticeable effect
7. **Glowing Title** - Headings change to golden yellow with intense double text-shadow glow
8. **Title Scale** - Headings also scale up slightly (105%)

The effect is now much more pronounced - cards will dramatically float up, expand, glow with cosmic energy, and tilt slightly when hovered. The titles will shine with golden power cosmic energy.
