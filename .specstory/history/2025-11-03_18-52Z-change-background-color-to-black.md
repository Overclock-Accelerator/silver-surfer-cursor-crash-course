The user wants to convert the background color back to black. I need to figure out which file contains the background color. Based on the project layout, there's a `styles.css` file which likely contains the styling. Let me first check what files are relevant and what the current background color is.

I should look at:
1. `styles.css` - likely contains the background color
2. Maybe `index.html` and other HTML files if they have inline styles

Let me start by reading the styles.css file to see what the current background color is.</details></think>

I'll check the current background color in the styles and change it back to black.

I can see the issue. On line 25, the background color is set to `#FFC0CB` which is pink. The user wants to change it back to black. Looking at the CSS variables defined at the top, there's `--deep-space: #000000;` which is black.

I'll change line 25 from `background: #FFC0CB;` to `background: #000000;` or use the CSS variable `var(--deep-space)`.</details></think>

I found it! The background is currently set to pink (`#FFC0CB`) on line 25. I'll change it back to black.
