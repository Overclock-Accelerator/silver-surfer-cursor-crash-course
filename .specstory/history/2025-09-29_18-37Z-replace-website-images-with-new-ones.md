# Replace website images with new ones (2025-09-29 18:37Z)

use the images in the @images/ and replace the images in the website

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to use the images from the `images/` folder and replace the images currently used in the website. Let me first understand what images are available and what the current website structure looks like.

From the folder contents, I can see these images:
1. `_silversurfer_card.jpg`
2. `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp`
3. `Silver_Surfer.webp`
4. `silver-surfer-flying.png` (0 bytes - might be empty)
5. `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp`

I need to:
1. Read the current HTML files to see what images they're using
2. Replace those image references with the actual images from the images folder

Let me start by reading the main HTML files: index.html, gallery.html, and powers.html to understand the current state.</details></think>

I'll help you replace the placeholder images with the actual images from the `images/` folder. Let me first check what images are currently being used in the website.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the files, I can see:

Current images being used in HTML:
- `images/silver-surfer-surfing.png` (index.html line 45)
- `images/silver-surfer-cosmic.png` (index.html line 77 and gallery.html lines 118)
- `images/silver-surfer-artistic.png` (gallery.html line 27)
- `images/silver-surfer-flying.png` (powers.html line 27)

Available images in the folder:
1. `_silversurfer_card.jpg`
2. `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp`
3. `Silver_Surfer.webp`
4. `silver-surfer-flying.png` (0 bytes - empty!)
5. `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp`

The README mentions the image filenames that were expected, but it seems the user has different images. I need to map the available images to the HTML references:

- `silver-surfer-surfing.png` â†’ could use `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp`
- `silver-surfer-cosmic.png` â†’ could use `Silver_Surfer.webp` or `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp`
- `silver-surfer-artistic.png` â†’ could use `_silversurfer_card.jpg`
- `silver-surfer-flying.png` â†’ it's empty (0 bytes), so I should use another available image

Let me create a reasonable mapping:
1. `silver-surfer-surfing.png` â†’ `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp` (hero image on index)
2. `silver-surfer-cosmic.png` â†’ `Silver_Surfer.webp` (used in index fun facts and gallery quotes)


3. `silver-surfer-artistic.png` â†’ `_silversurfer_card.jpg` (gallery hero)
4. `silver-surfer-flying.png` â†’ `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp` (powers hero)

I'll complete the image replacement strategy by matching the remaining images to their respective HTML locations. The card image works perfectly for the gallery hero section, while the dramatic "death" image suits the powers page as a striking visual representation of the character's intense moments.</details></think>

**Plan:**
I'll replace the placeholder image references with the actual images from the `images/` folder. The site currently references 4 different images, and I'll map them to the available images:

1. `silver-surfer-surfing.png` â†’ `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp`
2. `silver-surfer-cosmic.png` â†’ `Silver_Surfer.webp` 
3. `silver-surfer-artistic.png` â†’ `_silversurfer_card.jpg`
4. `silver-surfer-flying.png` â†’ `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp` (the existing file is empty)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>No linter errors, great! The task is complete. Since this was a straightforward task (just replacing image paths), I don't need to use the todo_write tool as per the guidelines - it's not a complex multi-step task.

Let me summarize what was done for the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully replaced all the placeholder images with the actual images from your `images/` folder:

**Changes made:**

1. **index.html** (hero section): `silver-surfer-surfing.png` â†’ `Surfin_Cosmic_Rays.webp`
2. **index.html** (fun facts section): `silver-surfer-cosmic.png` â†’ `Silver_Surfer.webp`
3. **gallery.html** (hero section): `silver-surfer-artistic.png` â†’ `_silversurfer_card.jpg`
4. **gallery.html** (quotes section): `silver-surfer-cosmic.png` â†’ `Silver_Surfer.webp`
5. **powers.html** (hero section): `silver-surfer-flying.png` â†’ `death-of-the-silver-surfer-1-featured-image.webp`

All image paths now point to the actual image files in your `images/` directory, and no linter errors were introduced.
