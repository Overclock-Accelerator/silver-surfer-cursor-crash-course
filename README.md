# Silver Surfer: An Ode to the Cosmic Hero

A fun and simple HTML/CSS project that pays tribute to the Silver Surfer, Marvel's herald of the cosmos. This project serves as a hands-on demonstration for learning AI-powered coding acceleration tools like Cursor and Claude Code.

## About This Project

This project is part of the **AI Training Program for the Overclock Accelerator**. It provides a beginner-friendly codebase to experiment with AI coding assistants and learn how they can enhance your development workflow.

The site includes:
- **Home Page** (`index.html`) - Introduction to the Silver Surfer
- **Powers Page** (`powers.html`) - Showcase of cosmic abilities
- **Gallery Page** (`gallery.html`) - Visual collection
- **Cosmic Travels Page** - Navigation features

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd silver-surfer-cursor-crash-course
```

### Running the Project

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
# On Windows
start index.html

# On macOS
open index.html

# On Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

Or use a local development server like Live Server in VS Code for hot-reloading.

## Experimenting with AI Coding Tools

This project is designed to help you practice using AI coding assistants. Here are some suggested prompts to try:

### Modifying Existing Pages

- "Add a glowing animation effect to the Silver Surfer heading on the home page"
- "Change the color scheme of the powers page to use purple and silver tones"
- "Make the gallery images zoom in smoothly when hovered over"
- "Add a subtle parallax scrolling effect to the background starfield"
- "Improve the mobile responsiveness of the navigation menu"

### Creating New Pages

- "Create a new 'Enemies' page that lists the Silver Surfer's greatest foes with descriptions"
- "Add an 'About' page that explains the character's origin story"
- "Build a 'Comics' page showcasing recommended reading with cover images"
- "Create a 'Timeline' page showing key events in Silver Surfer's history"
- "Add a contact/feedback page with a styled form"

### Adding Interactivity

- "Add a dark mode toggle button that switches between light and dark themes"
- "Create a slideshow carousel for the gallery page with next/prev buttons"
- "Add a search filter to the powers page so users can search by power name"
- "Implement smooth scroll navigation when clicking menu items"
- "Add a 'back to top' button that appears when scrolling down"
- "Create an interactive quiz about Silver Surfer trivia"
- "Add particle effects that follow the mouse cursor"

### Advanced Challenges

- "Refactor the CSS to use CSS Grid for the layout"
- "Add CSS animations that trigger when elements scroll into view"
- "Implement a JavaScript-powered constellation effect in the background"
- "Create a loading animation that plays before the page content appears"
- "Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)"

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you'll learn to:
- Use AI assistants to accelerate HTML/CSS development
- Iterate quickly on design ideas with AI-generated code
- Debug and refine AI-generated suggestions
- Understand when to accept, modify, or reject AI recommendations
- Build confidence in working with AI coding tools

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (for interactive features)

## Contributing

Feel free to experiment and make this project your own! The goal is to learn and have fun with AI-assisted development.

## Part of Overclock Accelerator

This project is part of the AI Training Program curriculum, designed to help developers learn to effectively collaborate with AI coding assistants.
